# Bywater

Is a simple application where I can play with the Release Candidate of Phoenix Framework, 1.8.0-rc.

At this point, I am really interested on learn about the Scopes. Here is the [Guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/1.8.0-rc.0/Phoenix.Scope.html). As by the release post, "Scopes provide a foundation for building multi-tenant, team-based, or session-isolated apps, slot cleanly into the router and LiveView lifecycle".

I am using this application to walk through the these possibilies.

### Bywater origin's name

Bywater is a fictional town in Middle-earth, located in the Shire. It is the home of Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins, and is the setting for J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
